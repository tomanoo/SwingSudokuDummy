# SwingSudokuDummy

An early, pre-alpha-prototype version of Sudoku written in Java Swing.

It has a fixed Sudoku board (not generated one) with basic validation, no menu, no restart method, just run and play.

It's also a hint-built Sudoku - if your typed number is valid, the cell background sets its color to green (red otherwise).
